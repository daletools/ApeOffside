Q: What is an arbitrage opportunity?
A: Arbitrage in sports betting is when you place bets on all outcomes of an event using different sportsbooks to guarantee a profit regardless of the result.

Q: How does the arbitrage calculator work?
A: The calculator takes odds for both teams and distributes your stake proportionally to lock in a guaranteed profit.


# Arbitrage Calculator (in this app)

The arbitrage calculator takes two decimal odds (e.g. 2.1 and 1.9) and a total stake amount from the user. It calculates the implied probability of each outcome, determines if arbitrage is possible, and then divides the stake proportionally to guarantee a profit regardless of the event's result.

It returns:
- The stake to place on each team
- The payout for both outcomes
- The guaranteed profit

This is only available when total implied probability is under 1.

Example:
If the odds are 2.10 and 1.95, and the user stakes $100, the calculator will allocate ~$48.78 and ~$51.22 to each team, yielding a payout of ~$102 and a guaranteed profit of $2.

If odds donâ€™t qualify for arbitrage (implied probability >= 1), the tool explains that arbitrage is not possible.
